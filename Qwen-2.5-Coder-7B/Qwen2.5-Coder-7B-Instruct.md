# Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct-GGUF

## Introduction

Qwen2.5-Coder is the latest series of Code-Specific Qwen large language models (formerly known as CodeQwen). As of now, Qwen2.5-Coder has covered six mainstream model sizes, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 7, 14, 32 billion parameters, to meet the needs of different developers. Qwen2.5-Coder brings the following improvements upon CodeQwen1.5:

- Significantly improvements in **code generation**, **code reasoning** and **code fixing**. Base on the strong Qwen2.5, we scale up the training tokens into 5.5 trillion including source code, text-code grounding, Synthetic data, etc. Qwen2.5-Coder-32B has become the current state-of-the-art open-source codeLLM, with its coding abilities matching those of GPT-4o.
- A more comprehensive foundation for real-world applications such as **Code Agents**. Not only enhancing coding capabilities but also maintaining its strengths in mathematics and general competencies.
- **Long-context Support** up to 128K tokens.

**This repo contains the instruction-tuned 7B Qwen2.5-Coder model in the GGUF Format**, which has the following features:
- Type: Causal Language Models
- Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training
- Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias
- Number of Parameters: 7.61B
- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 6.53B
- Number of Layers: 28
- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 28 for Q and 4 for KV
- Context Length: Full 32,768 tokens
  - Note: Currently, only vLLM supports YARN for length extrapolating. If you want to process sequences up to 131,072 tokens, please refer to non-GGUF models.
- Quantization: q2_K, q3_K_M, q4_0, q4_K_M, q5_0, q5_K_M, q6_K, q8_0

For more details, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-coder-family/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Coder), [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12186).

## Quickstart

Check out our [llama.cpp documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run_locally/llama.cpp.html) for more usage guide.

We advise you to clone [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and install it following the official guide. We follow the latest version of llama.cpp. 
In the following demonstration, we assume that you are running commands under the repository `llama.cpp`.

Since cloning the entire repo may be inefficient, you can manually download the GGUF file that you need or use `huggingface-cli`:
1. Install
   ```shell
   pip install -U huggingface_hub
   ```
2. Download:
   ```shell
   huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct-GGUF --include "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct-q5_k_m*.gguf" --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False

   ```
   For large files, we split them into multiple segments due to the limitation of file upload. They share a prefix, with a suffix indicating its index. For examples, `qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct-q5_k_m-00001-of-00002.gguf` and `qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct-q5_k_m-00002-of-00002.gguf`. You need to download all of them.
3. (Optional) Merge:
   For split files, you need to merge them first with the command `llama-gguf-split` as shown below:
   ```bash
   # ./llama-gguf-split --merge <first-split-file-path> <merged-file-path>
   ./llama-gguf-split --merge qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct-q5_k_m-00001-of-00002.gguf qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct-q5_k_m.gguf
   ```

For users, to achieve chatbot-like experience, it is recommended to commence in the conversation mode:

```shell
./llama-cli -m <gguf-file-path> \
    -co -cnv -p "You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant." \
    -fa -ngl 80 -n 512
```


## Evaluation & Performance

Detailed evaluation results are reported in this [📑 blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-coder-family/).
